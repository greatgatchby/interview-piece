### 🧪 **Why I Built It This Way**

I'm best known for building **fast UIs** — so every tech choice had one goal: performance *without* compromise 🚀

* 🧩 **Next.js 15 + App Router** → fast rendering + modern file structure
* 🧠 **tRPC + TypeScript** → no API guesswork, just flow
* 🧬 **Zustand + React Query** → simple, reactive state & data management
* 🎨 **Tailwind + Lucide** → clean, expressive interfaces
* 🔍 **Hugging Face ViT** → outsource the model, keep it snappy

It’s the kind of thing I build as I can ship fast, feel slick, and it's technically solid from day one.

### 🎯 **What It Shows**

* I know how to integrate **AI into real apps** (not just toy demos)
* I obsess over **frontend performance** and dev experience 🛠️
* I can build and ship **full-stack prototypes solo** — fast, clean, and scalable
